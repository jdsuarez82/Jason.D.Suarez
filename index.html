    <h1>Daisy: A Poem About a Korean Exchange Student</h1>
    <p>
        Daisy came from Seoul, so far away,
        With a smile that brightened each and every day.
        A Korean exchange student, full of grace,
        She brought a new perspective to our place.
    </p>
<p>
    She arrived with curiosity and wonder,
    Eager to learn and make friends like thunder.
    Her broken English, though a little shy,
    Couldn't hide her spirit that reached so high.
</p>

<p>
    She marveled at the sights and sounds anew,
    The language, the food, the customs too.
    She shared her culture, her stories and more,
    Enriching our lives, down to the core.
</p>

<p>
    Daisy was a gem, a diamond in the rough,
    With a heart so pure, and gentle as a puff.
    She faced challenges with courage and might,
    Overcoming obstacles, shining so bright.
</p>

<p>
    She taught us about resilience and grace,
    About embracing differences and finding our place.
    Her laughter was infectious, her presence so sweet,
    With Daisy around, life was truly a treat.
