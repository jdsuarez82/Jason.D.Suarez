  <h1>Daisy: A Poem</h1>
  <p>
    Daisy from afar, a foreign land,<br>
    A Korean lass with dreams so grand,<br>
    Her journey took her across the sea,<br>
    To study in a land unknown, but free.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a heart full of courage and grace,<br>
    She ventured into a new place,<br>
    Leaving behind her home and kin,<br>
    Embracing the unknown with a determined grin.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a foreign land, she found her way,<br>
    Navigating through each new day,<br>
    Learning language, culture, and more,<br>
    Her spirit shining, her heart pure.
  </p>
  <p>
    She made new friends, shared laughter and tears,<br>
    Her presence brightened, dispelling any fears,<br>
    Her smiles contagious, her kindness pure,<br>
    Daisy, a gem, for all to adore.
  </p>
  <p>
    With time, she grew, blossoming like a flower,<br>
    Gaining wisdom and strength with each passing hour,<br>
    Leaving indelible memories, a cherished part,<br>
    Daisy, a soul that touched many a heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    As her journey continued, the time flew by,<br>
    A Korean exchange student with wings to fly,<br>
    Leaving with memories, cherished and sweet,<br>
    A tale of courage, a journey complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    Daisy, a name that will never fade,<br>
    A story of courage, a beautiful serenade,<br>
    A shining example of strength and grace,<br>
    A Korean exchange student who left her trace.
